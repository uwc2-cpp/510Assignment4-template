Let's explore an open-ended design problem to which we can apply our skills in the design of object-centered systems. 

You are the chief designer of a consulting firm and you have been hired by The First National Bank to upgrade its customer database. 
You have chosen to rewrite the database using C++. Each customer account consists of a savings account and a checking account.
Begin the design by developing a set of use cases for the combined account that will describe how a customer may interact with the account.

Based upon your design thus far, use CRC cards to identify each of the classes that comprise your design. 
Be certain to identify the primary public and private aspects of each of the classes that make up a customer account.

Express each of the classes that you have identified in a class diagram. Don't get carried away here. There are only a couple of basic attributes of such an account.

To turn in your CRC cards, you can scan/photograph or copy them to a single computer document, specify a URL... anything works, just let us know in this document where to find them.

To turn in your class diagram you can scan/photograph hand drawings, or draw the class diagram using a computer graphics program, then provide the drawing in a PDF, JPEG, or other common format.  
Or URL... again, anything works, just let us know in this document where to find them.
